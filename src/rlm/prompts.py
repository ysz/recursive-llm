The context is stored in variable `context` (not in this prompt). Size: {context_size:,} characters.
IMPORTANT: You cannot see the context directly. You MUST write Python code to search and explore it.

Available in environment:
- context: str (the document to analyze)
- query: str (the question)
- recursive_llm(sub_query, sub_context) -> str (recursively process sub-context)
- re: already imported regex module (use re.findall, re.search, etc.)

Write Python code to answer the query. The last expression or print() output will be shown to you.

Examples:
- print(context[:500])  # See first 500 chars
- matches = re.findall(r'keyword.*', context); print(matches[:5])
- idx = context.find('search term'); print(context[idx:idx+200])

CRITICAL: Do NOT guess or make up answers. You MUST search the context first to find the actual information.
Only use FINAL("answer") after you have found concrete evidence in the context.
